Program_2:Solution of ODE of first order and first degree by 4th order Runge-Kutta method

<!--    QUESTION    -->
By using 4th order R-K method, solve dy/dx=xy1/3, y(1)=1 at x=1.5 by taking step size as 0.1.

<!--    CODE    -->
clear all;
clc;
f = @(x,y)x.*(y.^(1/3)) ;
x = 1; %initial value of x
y = 1; %initial value of y(x)
h =  0.1; %step size
X = 1.5; %y(1.5)
%X-x
while X-x  >= -10^(-10) %smaller value
   fprintf("value of y at x = %0.1f is %0.4f \n",x,y);
   k1 = h.*f(x,y);
   k2 = h.*f(x+h/2,y+k1/2);
   k3 = h.*f(x+h/2,y+k2/2);
   k4 = h.*f(x+h, y+k3);
   k = (k1 + 2.* k2 +2.*k3+k4 )./6;
   x =x+h;
   y = y+k;
end
